                Stealth Mode is a feature in Firetails that helps protect your privacy if someone (eg Eggman) gets a hold of your device.
                It's the Firetails equivalent of Chrome's Incognito, Firefox's Private Browsing, or Edge's InPrivate modes.
                Firetails doesn't store new cookies, passwords, or browsing history from sites visited while Stealth Mode is engaged.
                In addition, Firetails also doesn't load existing cookies from outside of Stealth Mode.
                However, Stealth Mode does <i>not</i> make you anonymous - websites and your ISP may still be able to identify you.
                Stealth Mode does not protect your computer against keyloggers, network sniffers, or other types of malware either.
                Stealth Mode <i>only</i> protects your data for if your device is stole physically.
                When Stealth Mode is disengaged (all windows are closed), cookies stored by sites viewed in Stealth Mode are deleted.
                Files that are downloaded while in Stealth Mode are stored on your computer, but are not logged in the Downloads manager.
                If you create a bookmark in Stealth Mode, it will remain on your computer, even when Stealth Mode is disengaged.

            <p>
                To engage Stealth Mode, click the <i class='fa fa-bars'></i> button and select "Engage Stealth Mode".
                It's that easy!
